  Our vision is to make a fully-featured programming language centered around
  the ideas of cooking. We have cooking styled syntax and lots of fun cooking 
  puns for the client to discover. Eventually, we want to use our programming 
  language to implement a simple text-based cooking game into our language. The 
  main goal is to successfully create a programming language that is usable.
