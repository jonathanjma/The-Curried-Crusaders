  Our vision is to make a fully-featured programming language centered around
  the ideas of cooking. We have cooking styled syntax and lots of fun cooking 
  puns for the client to discover. We also created an interactive REPL called
  ustove and implemented a fun programming game called MealGuess, which challenges
  users to guess the result of the evaluation of iCook expressions.
